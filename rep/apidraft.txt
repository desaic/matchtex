Input API:
Core functions:
struct Vertex{
required:
  vec3 position;
  etc
}
struct triangle{
required:
  int [3] index;
}
class Mesh{
required
  std::vector<Vertex> v;
  std::vector<Triangle> t;
optional:
  unsigned char * texture;
  etc.  
}
set_mesh(class Mesh &){
  let generator and simulator know about the mesh.
  Must have points and triangles.
  Optional. All specified by user:
  1. class Mesh can contain arbitrary properties
   for each vertex, triangle, voxel etc.
  2 .It can also contain any number of 2D or 3D textures
  defining various properties.
  3. It can contain constraints represented by functions or 
   parameters
}

class scene{
  vector<Force>
  vector<Light>
  vector<Camera>
}

class Goal{
  Mesh 
  or image
  or list of curves
  etc.
}

set_scene_and_goal( List<class scene , class Goal>)  ?
{
1.Simulator reads the scene.
  Scene can contain cameras, lights, forces.
  Can be interval of parameters in the most general case.
  
2 Comparator reads the corresponding goal.
  Goal can be a deformed mesh or a rendered result,
  or a more fine-grained specification of the transformation,
  e.g. rotation, translation.
}

Optional:
For convenience , user can choose an existing
 generator, simulator, comparator
or optimizer in the input api.
There can be many more small options.
